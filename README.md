# Housing Price Prediction
Predicting housing prices in California using data such as location, rooms, population, households, etc.

The data is available through Google Colab's `/content/sample_data` folder.

This project uses three approaches to predict prices: quadratic polynomial fitted to the features, a neural network, and a random forest regressor.
